    <p class="main-description">David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, visual artist, musician, and writer.
    A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, Lynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director,
    and the César Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion 
    award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. 
    In 2007, a panel of critics convened by The Guardian announced that 'after all the discussion, no one could fault 
    the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era', while
    AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking". 
    His work led to him being labeled "the first popular surrealist" by film critic Pauline Kael.
    Lynch studied painting before he began making short films in the late 1960s. His first feature-length film, 
    the surrealist Eraserhead (1977), became a success on the midnight movie circuit, and he followed that by directing 
    The Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984), and Blue Velvet (1986). Lynch next created his own television series with Mark Frost,
     the murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–91), which ran for two seasons. He also made the film prequel Twin Peaks: 
     Fire Walk with Me (1992), the road film Wild at Heart (1990), and the family film The Straight Story (1999) 
     in the same period.    </p>
